I am a software engineer with a passion for open-source software. I enjoy creating, contributing to, and training on tools to help developers succeed. Nothing is more fulfilling to me than sharing solutions and engaging with the community. This year, I spoke at a conference for the first time and I look forward to doing it again.

Currently, I am working on architecting a next generation mobile solution at FPS Gold. I also help maintain an advanced microservice architecture. My specialties include dotnet, Linux and Flutter. A large portion of my free time is dedicated to working on my Master's degree at Georgia Tech.

When I am not in front of a computer, I am in the mountains running, snowboarding, biking or backpacking.
